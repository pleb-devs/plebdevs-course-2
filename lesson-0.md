### What is PlebDevs?

##### I coined the term plebdev about 2 years ago as a framing to help me talk

##### about my developer journey in Bitcoin.

- A plebdev is a Bitcoin pleb turned dev
- Plebdevs are on the learning path.
- A plebdev might be someone who’s writing their first code or someone whose been
    coding for two years and is just working on getting to the next level
- Plebdevs is focused mainly on App development vs protocol development (though
    the door to protocol dev is always open!)
- Plebdevs embrace the label of n00b, being a new developer is 1000x better than
    being on the sidelines
- Bitcoin/Lightning/Nostr needs more Plebdevs!
