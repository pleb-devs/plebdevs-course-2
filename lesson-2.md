# Express basics

## Servers / HTTP API / CRUD


## What are HTTP API’s?

### ● An HTTP API is a web-based interface that allows communication

### between different systems or applications over the internet.

### ● API = “Application programming interface”

### ● It uses the HTTP protocol to define a set of rules and standards for

### sending and receiving messages between client and server.

### ● The API provides a standardized way for different applications to interact

### with each other, without requiring direct access to the source code or

### internal workings of the application.


### At a high level the API is just an interface for talking to our server using the

### http protocol

## What are HTTP API’s?


## What we know about API calls from course 1

- We made API calls “get requests” to request data from a few different API’s
- We posted data to legend.lnbits using “post requests”


## API endpoints and CRUD operations

###### ● HTTP APIs typically expose a set of ‘endpoints’ that can be accessed by clients

###### using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

###### ● These endpoints provide access to specific resources or functionalities of the

###### application, and can be used to create, retrieve, update, or delete data. (CRUD)

###### ● HTTP APIs can be used for a variety of purposes, such as integrating different

###### systems, enabling cross-platform communication, and building web

###### applications or services.

###### ● An open API is the way to have an open database


###### "Building an Express server is like riding a bike - except the bike is on fire, and

###### the road is also on fire, and everything is on fire because you're using

###### JavaScript" - probably Steve Jobs

# Let’s build our first

# Express Server!


To set up a new Node.js project, follow these steps:
● Create a new directory for your project by running the following command in the terminal:
mkdir pleb-wallet-backend
● Navigate into the new directory by running: cd pleb-wallet-backend
● Initialize a new Node.js project by running: npm init -y
● Create a file called “index.js” by running touch index.js
● Install express by running npm i express

## Setting up our local environment


_// Import the Express library_
const express = require("express");
_// Create a new instance of the Express server_
const server = express()
_// Use the built-in JSON middleware to parse incoming JSON requests_
server.use(express.json())
_// Set up a route to handle GET requests to the root path_
server.get("/", ( _req_ , _res_ ) => {
_// Send a JSON response with a "message" property set to "I'm alive!"
res_ .status( 200 ).json({ message: "I'm alive!" });
});
_// Set the server to listen on the provided port, or 5500 if no port is specified_
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5500 ;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
_// Log a message to the console when the server starts listening_
console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);

##### });


## Calling our new API endpoint

- To start your server run node index.js in your terminal
- You should see this message “Server listening on port 5500”
- Now you can go into either Insomnia or Postman and make a GET request to

###### “http://localhost:5500”

###### Success!


## The elements of an Express endpoint

- The req and res parameters in the route handler function represent the

#### request and response objects, respectively.

- The req object contains information about the incoming request, such

#### as the URL, HTTP headers, and any data sent in the request body.

- The res object is used to send a response back to the client, such as

#### setting the response status code and sending data in the response

#### body.


## Review

- Express is a popular Node.js web application framework that allows us to build

###### powerful, scalable and modular web applications.

- HTTP API stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Application Programming Interface,

###### it is a set of guidelines for building web applications and provides a way for different

###### software applications to communicate with each other.

- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic

###### functions that we can perform on a database.

- In Express, the req and res objects are used to handle HTTP requests and responses

###### respectively. The req object represents the incoming HTTP request from the client,

###### and the res object represents the outgoing HTTP response from the server.
