# Lesson 10:

# Learn Database

# development with Knex

## Learn database configuration, migrations, and seeds, with Knex.


#### What is Knex?

- Knex.js is like a translator. It lets you write requests to your database
    (like asking for data, or creating new data) in JavaScript, which is easier
    for many developers to work with. Knex.js then translates these
    JavaScript commands into SQL
- It's designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.


#### Why use Knex?

- ***Unified Query Syntax:** Knex provides a unified syntax to work with different SQL databases.
    This means that, in general, you can switch databases with minimal changes to your code.
- ***Schema Builder:** Knex also provides an interface to build and modify the database schema,
    making it easier to manage tables and relationships between them.
- Transactions: Support for transactions allows handling complex operations that should either
    fully succeed or fully fail, ensuring data integrity.
- Connection Pooling: Knex supports automatic connection pooling, managing the database
    connections for you for improved performance.
- ***Migration and Seeding:** Knex has built-in tools to help you migrate your database schema to
    new versions and seed it with data for testing.


**In summary:**
Knex gives a single library with simple local and production
configurations that allow us to build our schema once for multiple
SQL databases, update that schema in a structured manner with
‚Äúmigrations‚Äù, and easily add test data which is called ‚Äúseeding‚Äù or
‚Äúseeds‚Äù.

#### Why use Knex?


#### Knex table vs SQLite table

CREATE TABLE users (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
name TEXT NOT NULL
);
knex.schema.createTable('users', function( _table_ ) {
_table_ .increments('id');
_table_ .string('name').notNullable();
})


#### Full knex setup from a high level


#### A few resources upfront:

All of the knex commands we will be using can be found in the knex
cheat sheet here - https://devhints.io/knex
I also wrote a full walkthrough guide for a simple nodejs backend
using knex here -
https://github.com/AustinKelsay/node-backend-walkthrough


#### Install packages

Open up the terminal in pleb-wallet-backend and run the following:

###### npm i sqlite3 pg knex

**knex** : A SQL query builder for Node.js that provides a convenient way to interact
with databases.
**sqlite3** : A Node.js module that provides an SQLite database driver for use with
Knex.
**pg** : A PostgreSQL database driver for use with Knex, which enables you to connect

###### and interact with PostgreSQL databases from your Node.js application.


#### Setting up our database config with settings for

#### a local SQLite db and a production Postgres db

**Create knexfile.js for our knex configurations**
To use Knex to manage your database, you need to
create a knexfile.js file in the root directory of your
project. This file will contain the configuration settings
for your database, including the connection settings
for a local SQLite database we will use for
development and a production Postgres database

##### that we will deploy later


#### Knexfile.js

#### module .exports = {

development: {
client: "sqlite3",
connection: {
filename: "./db/dev.sqlite3",
},
useNullAsDefault: true,
migrations: {
directory: "./db/migrations",
},
seeds: {
directory: "./db/seeds",
},
},
production: {
client: "pg",
connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
migrations: {
directory: "./db/migrations",
},
seeds: {
directory: "./db/seeds",
},
},
};


module.exports = {
_// This is the configuration for your development environment_
development: {
_// This is the database client that knex will use, in this case SQLite_
client: "sqlite3",
_// This is the connection configuration to connect to your SQLite3 database_
connection: {
_// This is the file where your SQLite3 database is stored_
filename: "./db/dev.sqlite3",
},
_// By setting useNullAsDefault to true, we're telling SQLite to use NULL values when a value is not available_
useNullAsDefault: true,
_// These are the settings for your database migrations_
migrations: {
_// This is the directory where your migration files are stored_
directory: "./db/migrations",
},
_// These are the settings for your database seeds_
seeds: {
_// This is the directory where your seed files are stored_
directory: "./db/seeds",
},
},


_// This is the configuration for your production environment_
production: {
_// This is the database client that knex will use, in this case PostgreSQL (pg)_
client: "pg",
_// This is the connection configuration for your PostgreSQL database
// process.env.DATABASE_URL is an environment variable that points to your PostgreSQL database_
connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
_// These are the settings for your database migrations_
migrations: {
_// This is the directory where your migration files are stored_
directory: "./db/migrations",
},
_// These are the settings for your database seeds_
seeds: {
_// This is the directory where your seed files are stored_
directory: "./db/seeds",
},
},
};


#### Create a db directory and dbConfig.js

const knex = require("knex");
const config = require("../knexfile");
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || "development";
const db = knex(config[env]);
module.exports = db;


**"Migrations" are like a set of commands or a to-do list for your database.
They tell your database how to create, change, or remove tables and columns.
Why Use Migrations?**
‚óè Migrations help us keep track of changes we make to the database over
time.
‚óè They're especially useful when working with a team, as they allow everyone
to see what changes have been made and why.
‚óè Think of them as a version control for your database structure.

#### What is a migration?


#### How do migrations work with knex?

```
‚óè Each migration file contains instructions for making a specific change to the
database (the up function) and for undoing that change (the down function).
‚óè When you run a migration, it applies the changes from the up function.
‚óè If you need to undo a migration, you can run a command that applies the
```
### changes from the down function, reversing the up changes.

exports.up = function( _knex_ ) {
return _knex_ .schema.createTable('users', function( _table_ ) {
_table_ .increments('id');
_table_ .string('name');
_table_ .string('email');
})
}
exports.down = function( _knex_ ) {
return _knex_ .schema.dropTable('users');
}


- In the root of your project open up the terminal and run npx knex migrate:make
    create_users_table
- This will create a new migration file in the db directory (determined by your knexfile
    config)
- Knex gives us this command to help keep our database updates structured
- We get a timestamp in the name of the file and some boilerplate up and down
    functions to use

#### Create our first migration for ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù


#### Now let‚Äôs add our Users schema

1. Open up the new migration file that was just created with
    knex
2. Add in the schema code from the next slide


exports.up = function ( _knex_ ) {
_// Begins the creation of a new table named "users"_
return _knex_ .schema.createTable("users", function ( _table_ ) {
_// Creates a primary key column which auto increments its value for each new record
table_ .increments();
_// Creates a string column named "username" that cannot be null and must be unique across all records
// The second argument, 128, sets the maximum length of this string column
table_ .string("username", 128 ).notNullable().unique();
_// Creates a string column named "password" that cannot be null
// The second argument, 128, sets the maximum length of this string column
table_ .string("password", 128 ).notNullable();
_// Creates an integer column named "adminKey" that defaults to 1 if no other value is provided
table_ .string("adminKey").defaultTo(null);
});
};
exports.down = function ( _knex_ ) {
_// This function will drop the "users" table if it exists, effectively undoing the operations of the `up` function
// This is particularly useful for when you need to roll back the database to its previous state if something goes
wrong_
return _knex_ .schema.dropTableIfExists("users");
};


Now that we have created this migration and setup the user schema inside we can
run a command to ‚Äúmigrate latest‚Äù and have our knex run the latest migration files
through our database
Run npx knex migrate:latest in your terminal and you should see this:
Notice the message ‚ÄúUsing environment: development‚Äù üëÄ

#### Running our latest migration


- Now that we have run the latest migration knex automatically generates a local
    dev.sqlite3 database with our new table inside.
- If you remember in our config we define the name/path for our ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô db
- There is still no data so nothing to explore yet, but the structure of our table is there
    and ready to use!

#### Development DB created!


#### What are seeds?

When working with databases, we often need to add some initial data to the database.
This could be for testing, or to add some default values.
In Knex, we use something called "seeds" to add this initial data.
**What are Seeds?**
‚óè Seeds are files with code that add data into our database tables.
‚óè They are usually used to populate the database with default or dummy data, which is
very useful during development and testing.
**Why Use Seeds?**
‚óè Seeds can help us to test our application by creating predictable and repeatable data
sets.
‚óè They allow us to have a known state of the database to run our tests against.
‚óè Seeds can also be used to populate reference data, like a list of countries or user roles.


#### Creating a seed file for our ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù table

Open up your terminal and run npx knex seed:make 01_users

- Much like knex migrate:make seed:make will create a new file for us with a bit of
    boilerplate code to use for creating our test data
       **NOTE: Seeding your db will erase all previous data which is why we will only**
       **be doing it in development for testing purposes**


#### Add some test users to our new seed file

const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");
exports.seed = async function ( _knex_ ) {
_// Deletes ALL existing entries_
await knex("users").del();
await knex("users").insert([
{
id: 1 ,
username: "Alice",
password: bcrypt.hashSync("pass1", 14 ),
adminKey: "1234",
},
{
id: 2 ,
username: "Bob",
password: bcrypt.hashSync("pass2", 14 ),
adminKey: null,
},
]);
};


#### Running our user seeds

Now that we have created our seed file with two users that represent the
exact data we will be expecting we can run it through the database into
the users table and then make sure everything looks right.
Run npx knex seed:run in your terminal and you should see this:


#### Our full knex db setup

We did it! We went through the entire knex database setup for our backend:

- Creating a new table
- Running a migration for our new table
- Generating our local development db
- Creating a seed file with example data
- Ran that example data through our newly created table into our
    development database
       **Now let‚Äôs actually view our database**


#### Download sqlite db browser

## https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/


#### Open up DB Browser

```
Click ‚ÄúOpen Database‚Äù and navigate to the dev.sqlite3 db we created
in our backend repo
```

#### View the users table

Click on the ‚ÄúBrowse Data‚Äù tab and select the users table for the table dropdown
We can see our 2 users with their hashed passwords and adminKey‚Äôs!


#### Process for updating our db with knex

We have gone through an initial setup creating our first schema, generating
our dev db, and running some seeds through it but now we need to add our
Invoices table which will require an update to our current database.
All we really need to do is run a new migration, though when doing so we
should always be thoughtful and careful about what affects our changes
might have on the current structure of the database and the backend in
general.


#### Create a new migration for Invoices

- In the root of your project open up the terminal and run npx knex
    migrate:make create_invoices_table


#### Add our knex Invoices schema pt-1

exports.up = function ( _knex_ ) {
_// Begin creating a new table named "invoices"_
return _knex_ .schema.createTable("invoices", function ( _table_ ) {
_// Creates a primary key column named "id", which will auto-increment its value for each new record
table_ .increments("id").primary();
_// Creates a string column named "payment_request" that cannot be null and must be unique across all
records
table_ .string("payment_request").notNullable().unique();
_// Creates an integer column named "value" that cannot be null
table_ .integer("value").notNullable();
_// Creates a string column named "memo" for additional notes or comments
table_ .string("memo");
_// Creates an integer column named "fees"
table_ .integer("fees");


#### Add our knex Invoices schema pt-2

_// Creates a boolean column named "send" that cannot be null
table_ .boolean("send").notNullable();
_// Creates a boolean column named "settled" that cannot be null
table_ .boolean("settled").notNullable();
_// Creates a timestamp column named "settle_date" with a default value of 0
table_ .timestamp("settle_date").defaultTo(null);
_// Creates a timestamp column named "created_at" that defaults to the current time
table_ .timestamp("created_at").defaultTo( _knex_ .fn.now());
_// Creates an integer column named "user_id" that cannot be null
table_ .integer("user_id").unsigned().notNullable();
_// This sets up a foreign key constraint, where "user_id" in the "invoices" table references the "id" column in
the "users" table
table_ .foreign("user_id").references("id").inTable("users");
});
};


#### Add our knex Invoices schema pt-3

exports.down = function ( _knex_ ) {
_// This function will drop the "invoices" table, undoing the effects of the `up` function
// This is useful for resetting the database to its prior state if something goes wrong_
return _knex_ .schema.dropTableIfExists("invoices");
};


exports.up = function ( _knex_ ) {
_// Begin creating a new table named "invoices"_
return _knex_ .schema.createTable("invoices", function ( _table_ ) {
_// Creates a primary key column named "id", which will auto-increment its value for each new record
table_ .increments("id").primary();
_// Creates a string column named "payment_request" that cannot be null and must be unique across all records
table_ .string("payment_request").notNullable().unique();
_// Creates an integer column named "value" that cannot be null
table_ .integer("value").notNullable();
_// Creates a string column named "memo" for additional notes or comments
table_ .string("memo");
_// Creates an integer column named "fees"
table_ .integer("fees");
_// Creates a boolean column named "send" that cannot be null
table_ .boolean("send").notNullable();
_// Creates a boolean column named "settled" that cannot be null
table_ .boolean("settled").notNullable();
_// Creates a timestamp column named "settle_date" with a default value of 0
table_ .timestamp("settle_date").defaultTo(null);
_// Creates a timestamp column named "created_at" that defaults to the current time
table_ .timestamp("created_at").defaultTo( _knex_ .fn.now());
_// Creates an integer column named "user_id" that cannot be null
table_ .integer("user_id").unsigned().notNullable();
_// This sets up a foreign key constraint, where "user_id" in the "invoices" table references the "id" column in the "users" table
table_ .foreign("user_id").references("id").inTable("users");
});
};
exports.down = function ( _knex_ ) {
_// This function will drop the "invoices" table, undoing the effects of the `up` function
// This is useful for resetting the database to its prior state if something goes wrong_
return _knex_ .schema.dropTableIfExists("invoices");
};


#### Run the latest migration

## Run npx knex migrate:latest in your terminal


#### Now let‚Äôs add some Invoice seeds

#### run npx knex seed:make 02_invoices


#### Add some invoices seeds

exports.seed = async function ( _knex_ ) {
_// Deletes ALL existing entries_
await knex("invoices").del();
await knex("invoices").insert([
{
payment_request: "lnbcrt1u1p...",
memo: "yo",
value: 100 ,
settled: false,
send: false,
user_id: 1 ,
},
{
payment_request: "lnbcrt2u1p...",
value: 100 ,
fees: 10 ,
send: true,
settled: true,
settle_date: _knex_ .fn.now(),
user_id: 2 ,
},
]);
};


#### Run invoice seeds

## Run npx knex seed:run


#### Now let‚Äôs check out our development DB one

#### more time

Looks good on my side!
